# About bug.log

bug.log is a bug tracking application for developer teams and small businesses. The App features authorization, authentification with roles and role based permissions. It is built using React for the frontend and Express and MongoDB for the backend and database.
This is the app backend which can be accessed with RESTful HTTP requests.

I developed the app by myself as a learning project and for demonstration purposes only.
